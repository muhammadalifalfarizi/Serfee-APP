# Serfee-APP

Our team is developing an Android app to connect those in need with local, kind helpers. 
The aim of the project is to create a community that is fair and trusted. 
The app allows users to put in a request for assistance, broadcast their location, and receive offers from nearby helpers who can offer paid services. 
Users can negotiate a price with the helper through the conversation window and complete the transaction once an agreement is reached.
Once the task is completed, the individual who originally requested assistance can leave feedback for the paid helper, which provides helpful feedback to the community.
