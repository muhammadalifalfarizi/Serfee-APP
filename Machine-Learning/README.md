# Machine Learning Model

Our project involves building a Sentiment Analysis and Recommendation System model using TensorFlow. The Sentiment Analysis model will classify feedback into positive, negative, or neutral categories using NLP techniques and RNNs/LSTM. The Recommendation System will use geolocation data to suggest nearby service providers based on their high ratings.
